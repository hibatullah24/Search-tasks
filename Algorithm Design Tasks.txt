1- What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is an informal, human-readable description of an algorithm.
It uses plain English mixed with programming-like statements to explain the logic of a solution without using the syntax of any specific programming language.

- it focuses on what the algorithm does, not how it is coded. 

2- Why we use pseudocode
 * to plan the logic of a program before writing actual code
 * to understand and explain algorithms easily 
 * to communicate ideas between programmers and non programmers 
 * to avoid syntax errors while thinking about logic 

3- When we use pseudocode
 * Before coding a program 
 * in algorithm design and problem-solving stages 
 * in exams, assignments, and interviews
 * when explaining an algorithm in documentation or reports 

4- How to Write Pseudocode to Represent an Algorithm
 
 There is no strict rule, but good pseudocode should:
  * be clear and simple
  * use structured steps
  * avoid language-specific syntax
  * use common keywords such as:
   - START, END
   - READ, INPUT, OUTPUT
   - IF, ELSE
   - FOR, WHILE
  * be written step by step, logically

5- Example: Check if a String Contains a Specific Character
Problem: Check whether a given string contains the character '@'.
Pseudocode:
 START
 READ string
 SET found = FALSE 
 
 FOR each character in string 
   IF character = '@' THEN 
     found = TRUE
     EXIT LOOP
   END IF
 END FOR

IF found = TRUE THEN
    OUTPUT "Character found"
ELSE

Task 1: Calculate Average
START
READ numbers
SET sum = 0

FOR each number
    sum = sum + number
END FOR

average = sum / total numbers
OUTPUT average
END

* read the list of numbers
* calculates the total sum of all elements 
* divides the sum by the number of elements to find the average 
* output the average value
-----------------------------------------------------
Task 2: Even or Odd
START
READ number

IF number can be divided by 2
    OUTPUT "Even"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Odd"
END IF

END

* reads number and checks whether it is divisible by 2 
* if the reminder is zero the number is even otherwise it is odd 
------------------------------------------------------
Task 3: Find the Smallest Number in a List
START
READ numbers
SET smallest = first number

FOR each number
    IF number < smallest
        smallest = number
    END IF
END FOR

OUTPUT smallest
END

* scans through a list of numbers
* keeps track of the smallest value found
* It compares each number with the current smallest value and updates it when a smaller number is encountered
------------------------------------------------------
Task 4: Count Positive and Negative Numbers
START
READ numbers
SET positive = 0
SET negative = 0

FOR each number
    IF number > 0
        positive = positive + 1
    ELSE IF number < 0
        negative = negative + 1
    END IF
END FOR

OUTPUT positive
OUTPUT negative
END

* list of numbers and counts how many values are positive and how many are negative
* Zero values are ignored
* The final counts are then output
-----------------------------------------------------
Task 5: Remove Duplicates from a List
START
READ numbers
CREATE empty list unique

FOR each number
    IF number not in unique
        ADD number to unique
    END IF
END FOR

OUTPUT unique
END

* creates a new list that stores only unique values from the original list * Each element is checked before insertion to ensure duplicates are not  added 
----------------------------------------------------
Task 6: Prime Numbers
START
READ integer N
CREATE empty list primes

FOR i from 2 to N
    SET isPrime = TRUE

    FOR j from 2 to sqrt(i)
        IF i MOD j = 0 THEN
            isPrime = FALSE
            BREAK
        END IF
    END FOR

    IF isPrime = TRUE THEN
        ADD i to primes
    END IF
END FOR

OUTPUT primes
END

* identifies all prime numbers from 2 up to a given number 
* For each number, it checks whether it is divisible by any smaller number * If not divisible, the number is considered prime and added to the result
--------------------------------------------------
Task 7: Merge Two Sorted Lists

START
READ list A
READ list B
CREATE empty list C

WHILE A and B not empty
    TAKE smaller number
    ADD it to C
END WHILE

ADD remaining numbers to C
OUTPUT C
END

* takes two already sorted lists and combines them into a single sorted list
* It compares elements from both lists and adds the smaller one to the new list until all elements are merged
