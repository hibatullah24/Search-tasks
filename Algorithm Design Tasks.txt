1- What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is an informal, human-readable description of an algorithm.
It uses plain English mixed with programming-like statements to explain the logic of a solution without using the syntax of any specific programming language.

- it focuses on what the algorithm does, not how it is coded. 

2- Why we use pseudocode
 * to plan the logic of a program before writing actual code
 * to understand and explain algorithms easily 
 * to communicate ideas between programmers and non programmers 
 * to avoid syntax errors while thinking about logic 

3- When we use pseudocode
 * Before coding a program 
 * in algorithm design and problem-solving stages 
 * in exams, assignments, and interviews
 * when explaining an algorithm in documentation or reports 

4- How to Write Pseudocode to Represent an Algorithm
 
 There is no strict rule, but good pseudocode should:
  * be clear and simple
  * use structured steps
  * avoid language-specific syntax
  * use common keywords such as:
   - START, END
   - READ, INPUT, OUTPUT
   - IF, ELSE
   - FOR, WHILE
  * be written step by step, logically

5- Example: Check if a String Contains a Specific Character
Problem: Check whether a given string contains the character '@'.
Pseudocode:
 START
 READ string
 SET found = FALSE 
 
 FOR each character in string 
   IF character = '@' THEN 
     found = TRUE
     EXIT LOOP
   END IF
 END FOR

IF found = TRUE THEN
    OUTPUT "Character found"
ELSE
