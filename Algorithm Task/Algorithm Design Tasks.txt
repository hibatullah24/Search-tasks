1- What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is an informal, human-readable description of an algorithm.
It uses plain English mixed with programming-like statements to explain the logic of a solution without using the syntax of any specific programming language.

- it focuses on what the algorithm does, not how it is coded. 

2- Why we use pseudocode
 * to plan the logic of a program before writing actual code
 * to understand and explain algorithms easily 
 * to communicate ideas between programmers and non programmers 
 * to avoid syntax errors while thinking about logic 

3- When we use pseudocode
 * Before coding a program 
 * in algorithm design and problem-solving stages 
 * in exams, assignments, and interviews
 * when explaining an algorithm in documentation or reports 

4- How to Write Pseudocode to Represent an Algorithm
 
 There is no strict rule, but good pseudocode should:
  * be clear and simple
  * use structured steps
  * avoid language-specific syntax
  * use common keywords such as:
   - START, END
   - READ, INPUT, OUTPUT
   - IF, ELSE
   - FOR, WHILE
  * be written step by step, logically

5- Example: Check if a String Contains a Specific Character
Problem: Check whether a given string contains the character '@'.
Pseudocode:
 START
 READ string
 SET found = FALSE 
 
 FOR each character in string 
   IF character = '@' THEN 
     found = TRUE
     EXIT LOOP
   END IF
 END FOR

IF found = TRUE THEN
    OUTPUT "Character found"
ELSE

Task 1: Calculate Average
START
READ numbers
SET sum = 0

FOR each number
    sum = sum + number
END FOR

average = sum / total numbers
OUTPUT average
END

* read the list of numbers
* calculates the total sum of all elements 
* divides the sum by the number of elements to find the average 
* output the average value


parameter:
- input: list
-output : average
-variable: sum , number, average, total numbers
- loop 
-----------------------------------------------------
Task 2: Even or Odd
START
READ number

IF number can be divided by 2
    OUTPUT "Even"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Odd"
END IF

END

* reads number and checks whether it is divisible by 2 
* if the reminder is zero the number is even otherwise it is odd 

parameter:
- input : number 
- variable : number 
- condition : number %2 == 0 
- output : even , odd
------------------------------------------------------
Task 3: Find the Smallest Number in a List
START
READ numbers
SET smallest = first number

FOR each number
    IF number < smallest
        smallest = number
    END IF
END FOR

OUTPUT smallest
END

* scans through a list of numbers
* keeps track of the smallest value found
* It compares each number with the current smallest value and updates it when a smaller number is encountered

parameters:
- input : list
- variable : smallest, number
- condition : number < smallest
- output : smallest
- loop: numbers 
------------------------------------------------------
Task 4: Count Positive and Negative Numbers
START 
PositiveCount = 0 
NegativeCount = 0
TotalNumbers = 0

INPUT Number = N
READ N 

IF Number > 0 THEN:
  PositiveCount = PositiveCount + 1

ELSE  Number < 0 THEN:
  NegativeCount = NegativeCount + 1

TotalNumbers = TotalNumbers + 1

End 


* list of numbers and counts how many values are positive and how many are negative
* Zero values are ignored
* The final counts are then output

parameters:
- input : N , Number 
- output : PositiveCount, NegativeCount 
- Condition : TotalNumbers < N
- Loop  
-----------------------------------------------------
Task 5: Remove Duplicates from a List
START
READ numbers
SET uniqueList = empty list

FOR each number in numbers
    IF number NOT IN uniqueList
        ADD number to uniqueList
    END IF
END FOR

OUTPUT uniqueList
END


parameter:
- input : list
- output : uniqueList
- variable: numbers, uniqueList, number
- loop : for loop 
- condition : number NOT IN uniqueList
----------------------------------------------------
Task 6: Prime Numbers
START
READ N

FOR number from 2 to N
    SET prime = true

    FOR divisor from 2 to number - 1
        IF number % divisor == 0
            prime = false
        END IF
    END FOR

    IF prime == true
        OUTPUT number
    END IF
END FOR

END



parameter: 
- variable: N, number, divisor, prime
- Input: N
- Output: N
- Condition: number % divisor == 0, prime ==true
- Loop: for loop [2 to number -2]

--------------------------------------------------
Task 7: Merge Two Sorted Lists

START
READ list A
READ list B
CREATE empty list C

WHILE A and B not empty
    TAKE smaller number
    ADD it to C
END WHILE

ADD remaining numbers to C
OUTPUT C
END

* takes two already sorted lists and combines them into a single sorted list
* It compares elements from both lists and adds the smaller one to the new list until all elements are merged
-----------------------------------------
Task 8: Find the Second Largest Number
START
READ numbers
SET largest = very small
SET second = very small

FOR each number
    IF number > largest
        second = largest
        largest = number
    END IF
END FOR

OUTPUT second
END

* the algorithm reads a list of numbers.
* it sets the largest and second largest values to very small numbers 
* it checks each number in the list one by one.
* if a number is greater than the current largest value, the largest value is moved to second largest. 
* the new number becomes the largest value
* after checking all numbers, the algorithm outputs the second largest number.

Task 9: Palindrome String
START
READ word
MAKE word lowercase

IF word equals reversed word
    OUTPUT "Palindrome"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Not Palindrome"
END IF

END

-----------------------------
Task 10: Fibonacci Numbers
START
READ N
SET first = 0
SET second = 1

OUTPUT first
OUTPUT second

REPEAT N times
    next = first + second
    OUTPUT next
    first = second
    second = next
END REPEAT

END
